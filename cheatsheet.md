# Game commands:
- When START<>, you can resume or start with $200 and 0 reputation point
- Each choice has a different probability of success, which is not revealed to you
    - 1 and 2 are the choices to make in the game to gain reputation points and/or money in each level or side quest.
    - If you failed a mission, you lose $100 and 10 reputation points you have to start at the first mission part of the current mission
- Side Quests are available if you can't unlock a mission
- Press enter if you are asked to enter.
- You also have the option to pause the game and return later

# SPOILER ALERT
- The outcomes of the choice are only determined by probability, which will then determine the results of the points to get for each quest/mission. Success results in gaining reputation points and money, while the failure outcome results in losing reputation points and money.
- Shortest way to win (with the lowest probability of using Side Quest): 
    - Mission 1: Choose the expensive car > Outrun the police > Delivery immediately
    - Mission 2: Quick Grab > Direct & Bribe guards
    - Mission 3: Evade the police > (Either betray or split the loot)
